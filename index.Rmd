# Some text and picture
Hello, I am Xinyi. This is my first website. I don’t know what to say, but they told me to leave some text here, so I leave a poem:


My steadfast lover, true, with no regret's sound,

Hear my whisper soft as your eyes lead the way—

Ahead, dark thorns and mires do abound,

Yet dreams of splendor past, behind you lay.

# Here are three plots
## First, load necessary packages:
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
library(flexdashboard)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rnoaa)
```
## Importing and cleaning the dataset:
```{r}
data(ny_noaa)

set.seed(123) # I randomly choose 1000 lines because the dataset is too large
ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  sample_n(1000)

ny_noaa <- ny_noaa %>%
  filter(!is.na(prcp), !is.na(snow))
```

## Scatter Plot
```{r}
plot_ly(data = ny_noaa, 
        x = ~tmax, 
        y = ~tmin, 
        type = "scatter", 
        mode = "markers",
        color = ~id, 
        marker = list(size = 10, opacity = 0.6))
```

## Boxplot
```{r}
ny_noaa %>%
  mutate(date = as.factor(date)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~tmax, color = ~id, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

## Bar Chart
```{r}
plot_ly(data = ny_noaa, x = ~tmax, y = ~tmin, type = 'bar', colors = 'viridis') %>%
  layout(title = "Bar Chart of Dates", xaxis = list(title = "tmax"), yaxis = list(title = "Count"))
```
