# Introduction
Hello, I am Xinyi. This is my first website. 
My UNI is xz3298. 

My email: xz3298@cumc.columbia.edu

My github account is [XinyiZheng7](https://github.com/XinyiZheng7)

I major in [Environmental Health Data Science](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/master-science/environmental-health-data-science)

Also, I give a brief introduction of my academic and professional experience below : 

# My academic and professional experience

* [My resume](about.html)

# Here are three plots

* [Scatterplot, Piechart and Barchart](dashboard.html)


# Some additional text and pictures

I don’t know what to say, but I need to leave some text and pictures here, so I leave a poem written by me and some fantastic pictures my friends painted for me:


My steadfast lover, true, with no regret's sound,

Hear my whisper soft as your eyes lead the way—

Ahead, dark thorns and mires do abound,

Yet dreams of splendor past, behind you lay.
