# Some text and picture
Hello, I am Xinyi. This is my first website. I don’t know what to say, but they told me to leave some text here, so I leave a poem:


My steadfast lover, true, with no regret's sound,

Hear my whisper soft as your eyes lead the way—

Ahead, dark thorns and mires do abound,

Yet dreams of splendor past, behind you lay.

# Here's three plots
## First, load necessary packages:
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
library(flexdashboard)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```
## Importing and cleaning the dataset:
```{r}
data(nyc_airbnb)
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) |>
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long) |>
  filter(
    !is.na(rating), 
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500)
```

## Scatter Plot
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Boxplot
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) |> 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

## Bar Chart
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  count(neighbourhood) |> 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) |> 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```
