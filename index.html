<h1>Some text and picture</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Xinyi. This is my first website. I don’t know what to
say, but they told me to leave some text here, so I leave a poem:</p>
<p>My steadfast lover, true, with no regret’s sound,</p>
<p>Hear my whisper soft as your eyes lead the way—</p>
<p>Ahead, dark thorns and mires do abound,</p>
<p>Yet dreams of splendor past, behind you lay.</p>
